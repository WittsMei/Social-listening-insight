Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed social listening insights table. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Your social listening insights table should include:

The insights you gained about what your audience likes about your brand, products, competitors, and/or other related trends from filtering the data for positive mentions and analyzing that data. 

The insights you gained about what your audience dislikes about your brand, products, competitors, and/or other related trends from filtering the data for negative mentions and analyzing that data. 

A description of any additional criteria for which you created a filter.

Any new insights gained from filtering the data for additional criteria.

A description of the actions you plan to take based on your insights and analysis.

Note: The exemplar represents one possible version of the social listening insights table. Yours will likely differ in certain ways. Whatâ€™s important is that your table describes specific insights based on the data in the spreadsheet and related actions you plan to take.
